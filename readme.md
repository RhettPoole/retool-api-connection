## Overview

**Project Title**: Retool Web Scraper

**Project Description**: The code in this folder will be an API that is used to feed data to a front end tool called Retool. The data will be stored for an AI model to access. The user will be able to ask the AI about the data that is being fed to it. In this scenario, this specific AI will be given data about RV's and how to diagnose the appliances in the RV. 

**Project Goals**: I will likely start with fridges, or furnaces. I would also like the AI to retrieve and give a "diagnostic form" for the user to use. I need to build an API, design the front-end UI, connect JSON or database.
